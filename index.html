      <h2>Hello.</h2>

      <h2>My Skills.</h2>
      <div class="skill-row">

        <img class="prs" src="images/pressure.jpg" alt="img">
        <h3>I can work under pressure</h3>
        <p>I can easily work under pressure without letting it affecting my overall productivity. There has been multiple situations where I was under alot of pressure
          to complete a project and I could do it without much problem.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="obs" src="images/Obstacle.png" alt="img">
        <h3>Can overcome obstacles.</h3>
        <p>This is one of my best skill. Once I decide to do something, I see it more of a challenge and then try my best to overcome the challenge as quickly
          as possible. Take example a hard videogame, like dark souls. I've Completed all the three dark souls and I had taken it as a challenge to myself to be good
          enough to beat such a hard game and I did it.</p>

      <h2>My list of Hobbies</h2>
      <div class="hobbies-row">
        <img class="gam" src="images/gaming.png" alt="img">
        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>Playing video games is one of my most favourite hobbies. I really enjoy gaming and I can easily play for hours, which often leads to some work
          remaining undone, hehe. But yes, I am the happiest when I play a game I enjoy as it totally immerses me in the game. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="hobbies-row">
        <img class="bok" src="images/Book.jpg" alt="img">
        <h3>Reading a Book</h3>
        <p>My another favourite hobby is to read a book in total silence. I love reading books as it helps me imagine the situation inside my head, like the house the
          main character's living in, or the crime situation. Reading also helps me to understand the history of many places like Russia or Europe.</p>
